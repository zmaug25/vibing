# Zoom Vibe Coding Hackathon 2025

This is the shared repo. Each team works only inside **projects/<your-project>**.

Start here:
1) Make a branch: `git checkout -b team-yourname`
2) Create your folder: `mkdir projects/<your-project>`
3) Add something small (e.g., a README) and commit/push.
4) Open a Pull Request to `main`.

If you haven't cloned yet, see the "Getting Started" guide shared in chat.
